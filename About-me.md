## About Me 🌱☁️
I am currently enrolled in the AWS re/Start programme, building hands‑on experience in cloud fundamentals while collaborating on practical projects and labs. I’m learning to administer Linux systems 🐧, write automation scripts 💻, and deploy core AWS services ☁️ with a focus on security, reliability, and cost awareness. My creative background as a novelist ✍️ sharpens my communication and problem‑structuring skills, and coding has become a newly found passion 🎯 that I enjoy exploring alongside my writing. I’m committed to turning the skills I’m gaining into real, deployable projects 🚀 and an increasingly professional portfolio as I prepare for an entry‑level cloud role.
