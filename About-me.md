## About me
I am currently enrolled in the AWS re/Start programme, building hands‑on experience in cloud fundamentals while collaborating on practical projects and labs. I’m learning to administer Linux systems, write automation scripts, and deploy core AWS services with a focus on security, reliability, and cost awareness. My creative background as a novelist sharpens my communication and problem‑structuring skills, and coding has become a newly found passion that I enjoy exploring alongside my writing. I’m committed to turning the skills I’m gaining into real, deployable projects and an increasingly professional portfolio as I prepare for an entry‑level cloud role.

## Skills I am acquiring (top ones)

AWS core services (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Lambda) 
— deploying and configuring basic infrastructure and serverless functions.
Linux & command line — system navigation, package management, permissions and basic administration.
Scripting & automation (Python, Bash) — small utilities, automation of operational tasks and repeatable workflows.
Infrastructure as Code & repeatable deployments — CloudFormation or CDK fundamentals and writing reproducible stacks.
Networking & security basics — VPC/subnet design, security groups, NACLs, IAM best practices, and encryption concepts.
Observability & troubleshooting — CloudWatch metrics/logs, CloudTrail, incident triage and root cause thinking.
Version control & collaboration — Git/GitHub workflows, branching, pull requests and basic CI/CD concepts.
What I plan to live with after the programme

Continuous learning as a daily habit: follow labs, build mini-projects, and study for AWS Cloud Practitioner (and next certifications).
A public portfolio: maintain GitHub repos that show cloud deployments, scripts, and short writeups illustrating problems solved.
Security-first defaults: designing with least-privilege, backups, monitoring and cost-awareness baked into every project.
Regular coding practice: small daily or weekly challenges to deepen programming skills and expand beyond examples from the course.
Creative balance: continue writing novels to strengthen storytelling, documentation, and attention to detail — using narrative skills to explain technical work.
Community and collaboration: participate in study groups, local meetups or online forums to learn from others and give back.
Career focus with realistic steps: target Cloud Support / Junior DevOps / Cloud Operations roles while building toward Solutions Architect or SysOps specializations.
