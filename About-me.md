## About me
I am completing my AWS re/Start program where Iwill gain hands-on experience with core AWS services (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Lambda) and learn to use Linux, Bash scripting, Git, 
and basic infrastructure-as-code patterns. I am enjoying building small, secure, and cost-conscious cloud solutions while documenting the steps so others can reproduce them.

## Skills
- AWS: EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Lambda, CloudWatch  
- IaC: Terraform (intro) / CloudFormation (intro)  
- Scripting: Bash, Linux CLI  
- Containers: Docker (basics)  
- Tools: Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions
