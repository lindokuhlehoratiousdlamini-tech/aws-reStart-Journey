# Compute Lab: EC2 Launch

## Objectives
The AWS re/Start programme is a beginner-friendly training that teaches people how modern computers, networks, and cloud services work. 
## Tasks
- 🚀 **Launching EC2 Instance:** I created a new EC2 instance named Web Server. I chose Amazon Linux 2 AMI and t3.micro instance type.
- 📊 **Monitor Your Instance:** I checked CPU usage and system status in the EC2 Monitoring tab to make sure the instance was running correctly.
- 🌐 **Update Security Group and Access the Web Server:** I added an inbound rule for HTTP (port 80) from anywhere so I could access the web server.
- 📦 **Resize Instance and EBS Volume:** I stopped the instance, changed the type to t3.small, and increased the volume from 8 GB to 10 GB.
- 🛡️ **Test Termination Protection:** I enabled termination protection, tried to delete the instance, and confirmed AWS blocked the action until I disabled it.

## Challenges
- 😎 I did not face any challenges during this lab; everything was straightforward.

## Takeaways
- 🔑 Make sure your security group has the correct inbound rules.
- ✅ Enable termination protection to avoid accidentally deleting instances.
